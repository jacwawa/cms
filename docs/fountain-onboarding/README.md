# Fountain CMS Onboarding Guide

This guide helps new users become productive in Fountain quickly and safely.

## Audience

- Content editors creating show pages and event listings
- Publishers preparing and launching content
- Team members updating collections and home page modules

## How To Use This Guide

1. Start with [Quickstart](./quickstart.md).
2. Follow [Core Workflows](./workflows.md) for common tasks.
3. Use [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) if you hit errors.
4. Copy approved templates from [Snippets and Reference](./snippets-reference.md).
5. Run [Launch Checklist](./launch-checklist.md) before publishing.

## First Week Outcomes

By the end of week one, a new user should be able to:

- Create a Show and fill required title/date fields
- Configure right-rail controls safely for launch
- Add images, captions, and PDF assets correctly
- Preview content in the correct template URL
- Apply ticketing setup for single-date and multi-date events
- Resolve common service/cache and broken-link issues

## Fountain Areas You Will Use Most

- `Shows`: create and maintain show pages
- `Events`: auto-generated instances tied to show dates
- `Collections`: home page and landing page modules
- `Assets`: upload images and PDF files
- `CMS`: San Juan Hill content area

## Important Operating Rules

- Keep new content `Invisible` until approved.
- Use relative URLs where directed (for internal page links).
- For imported organizations (Film, LC Theater, Juilliard), default organization to `Lincoln Center` unless told otherwise.
- For date style, use `:00` where needed and avoid spaces around en dashes.

## Documentation Maintenance

If your team updates CMS behavior, update these files in the same pull request:

- [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)
- [workflows.md](./workflows.md)
- [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)
- [snippets-reference.md](./snippets-reference.md)
- [launch-checklist.md](./launch-checklist.md)
